# qudi LQNO
This is the qudi LQNO based on ulm-qudi platform. It is mostly focused to perform ultrafast pulsed experiment using national instrument card. In addition to Qudi-ulm it consist the following features. 
## Features
  * Photodetector acquisition with oscilloscope
  * Faster and analog and digital DAQ acquisition
  * Analog acquisition with DAQ for pulsed measurements
  * Digital acquisition with DAQ for pulsed measurements
  * Photon counting with DAQ
  * Pulse extraction improved
  * ODMR with arbitrary/random MW sweep
  * ODMR acquisition with spectrometer
  * Lock-in detection
  * New pulse sequences introduced 
  
# Technical

Technical description on the connectio and synchronization can be found in paper [Optically detected magnetic resonance with an open source platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00005.pdf) 

## Citation
As a good scientific practice the two papers should be cited [Optically detected magnetic resonance with an open source platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00005.pdf)
